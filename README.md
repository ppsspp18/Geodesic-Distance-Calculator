# Geodesic-Distance-Calculator
geodesic distance calculator using python
Technologies Used: Python, Tkinter, Mathematics (Vincenty Formula)
Developed a geodesic distance calculator using the Vincenty formula to compute the distance between two geographical coordinates on the Earth's ellipsoidal surface.
Designed a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to allow users to input latitude and longitude for two points and display the calculated distance in kilometers.
